// inside of our schema, were going to define all of the datatypes that our graphql API can send/receive to/from our client and also inside our schema, we're going to have to define a structure for all our queries, mutations, subs fns that our API is able to do

// long story short, we're going to define the structure of all of our types, entity or user as well as operation types such as queries, mutations and subscriptions
//  a schema's main purpose is to make sure the API is typesafe and is one of the main benefits of using graphql
