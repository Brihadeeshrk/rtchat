// when building a graphql API, the most important thing we're going to need is a schema
// a graphql schema is basically a structure of our graphQL API
// Inside of our schema, we're going to define all of our data types our graphQL API can send/receive to/from our client app
// inside our schema we're going to have to define a structure for all our queries, mutation and subscription fns that we should be able to do
// long story short, we're going to have to define the structure of all types, entity types such as User, Conversation or Operation Types such as QUERY, MUTATION, SUBSCRIPTION
// the main purpose of our schema is to ensure that our API is typesafe
